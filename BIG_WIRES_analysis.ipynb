    "The BIG WIRES Act (H.R. 5551, S. 2827) was introduced in late 2023.  It is a bill that proposes to streamline the permitting process for the development of large, high-voltage electrical transmission lines in the United States.  The introduction to the text of the Act reads:\n",
    "> Congress finds that—\n",
    "\n",
    "> (1) interregional electric transmission is foundational to a modern grid and a growing economy based on affordable and abundant energy;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (2) in recent decades, the interregional electric grid infrastructure of North America, and of the United States in particular, has stagnated;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (3) since 2014, the total capacity of planned or newly constructed large-scale interregional transmission in North America has amounted to less than 1⁄3 that of South America, 1⁄6 that of Europe, and 1⁄30 that of China;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (4) such a shortage of interregional transmission threatens the reliability of the electric grid of the United States and its resiliency to extreme weather events and cyber and physical attacks while artificially inflating energy prices for the people of the United States;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (5) the damages resulting from that interregional transmission shortfall have been borne across the United States, in part during extreme weather events, including the 2022 freeze affecting the majority of the United States, the 2020 and 2022 heat waves in California, the 2019 heat wave and 2021 freeze in Texas, the 2018 cyclone on the East Coast, and the 2014 polar vortex in the Northeast and Midwest, and those extreme weather events collectively cost the people of the United States hundreds of billions of dollars;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (6) new interregional transmission, and transfer capability achieved by means of other technologies and grid-operational practices, represents a unique opportunity to fortify the critical energy infrastructure of the United States while lowering the cost of living for families;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (7) studies of interregional transmission routinely find benefit-cost ratios as high as 2.5, in line with real-world experience;\n",
    "\n",
    "> (8) by relieving grid congestion and promoting more efficient grid planning and operation, new interregional transmission presents an all-of-the-above opportunity for the full energy-generating portfolio of renewable, fossil, and nuclear resources of the United States; and\n",
    "\n",
    "> (9) interregional transmission represents a 2-way value proposition, with secure careers for workers in energy communities and competitively sourced, low-cost, reliable energy for industrial, commercial, and residential energy customers nationwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points #4 and #8 above caught my eye because they speak to an electrical grid that is potentially unreliable and that does not fully leverage the clean-energy capacity in the United States.  Specifically I wondered: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the current state of high-voltage electrical transmission in the U.S.?\n",
    "2. What are the regional and national needs for electrical transmission in the U.S.?\n",
    "3. What other factors (i.e., placement of clean electricity generation facilties and carbon-equivalent emmissions from other electricity generation)  motivate the construction of new high-voltage transmission lines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administraton (EIA) and other sources, I sought to address these questions using figures, images, and modeling in Python, the full code for which is found in the cells below.  Good analysis is transparent and builds on previous learning.  For that reason, I encourage your careful review to determine whether my analysis is correct and, if so, to build on it to answer other more advanced questions you may have. "

    "As I expected, there are many high-voltage transmission lines connecting the states within the eastern and western halves of the US continent, which form the Eastern Interconnection and Western Interconnection regions. However, relatively few high-voltage transmission lines connect these two regions (connections to the Texas Interconnection Region fare better). This is understandable for two reasons. First, transmission lines are run at high voltages to minimize the voltage loss as much as possible over long distances, but the longer the distance the greater the loss.  Therefore one line connecting the western-most states with the eastern-most states is infeasible.  Second, previous attempts to connect the Interconnections in the second half of the 20th century were disconnected because they were not stable.  This was due to frequency fluctuations inherent to mismatches between power generation and power usage in AC systems (see [4]).  Current existing connections between the eastern and western halves of the country number seven DC ties totaling <b>1.32 GW</b> total. Existing high-voltage DC (HVDC) ties are shown below:"

    "The above choropleth demonstrates that each interconnection region has unique needs.  The Western Interconnection region, as a whole, is a net exporter of electricity.  However, the Eastern and Texas interconnection regions are net importers of electricity, and this is not compensated for by the exports from the Western Interconnection region.  To compare these data to the power capacity of existing HVDC ties, it was necesary to convert from BTU (a unit of energy) to GW (a unit of power).  Converting the BTU values to GW requires dividing the annual total by 8760 to yield BTU/hour, then coverting this to GW (1 BTU/hr = 0.29307107 W).  Doing so reveals that the Eastern Interconnection region requires a net import of <b>1.11 GW</b> while the Texas interconnection region requires a net import of <b>1.63 GW</b>.  Comparing to the DC tie capacity above of 1.32 GW, it is clear that these ties are near or at the limit of their capacity. There are slight inaccuracies here because the interconnection regions do not occur strictly along state lines.  A county-level analysis would provide more accurate outcomes."

In particular, as the United States transitions to a more clean-energy future we expect that electrical demands will increase compared to current state due to increased use of electric cars, furnaces, heat pumps, water heaters, and so on.  Further, the carbon-equivalent emissions profiles of the electricity generation become important to consider.

    "<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis illustrated several major findings:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>The existing network of high-voltage electrical transmission lines within the United States is primarily among nearby states.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Interconnections between regions in the United States is achieved through high-voltage DC ties, which are at or nearly at capacity.</li>\n",
    "    <li>There are some states that export electricity and others that import electricity but these states are not always adjacent.  Some states import a large fraction of their electricity, which is not fully supported by neighboring states.</li>\n",
    "    <li>There is a wide variety of types of electricity generation in use and different states present widely-varying emissions profiles for the electricity they generate.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Among the states that exported electricity in 2022, there is a widely varying profile of emissions resulting from that electricity generation.  The lowest-emissions electricity from exporting states is scattered throughout the country.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The use of solar and wind for electricity generation is not evenly distributed across the states, and opportunties exist to enhance the transmission of electricity from those states producing it to adjacent states, especially those with high-emissions electricity generation and/or that are net importers of electricity.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings, when taken together, paint a picture of an existing need for increased electricity transmission capacity, especially to support future electricity demand due to clean energy efforts through other bills, like the Inflation Reduction Act.  Although I did not study it here, the rate of solar electricity generation is increasing, which is expected to increase this transmission need in the future. This analysis does not indicate whether the BIG WIRES Act is the optimal approach for such capacity improvement, but does support Points #4 and #8 in the introduction."
